1805,"Dim vales?and shadowy floods?  And cloudy-looking woods,  Whose forms we can?t discover  For the tears that drip all over:  Huge moons there wax and wane?  Again?again?again?  Every moment of the night?  Forever changing places?  And they put out the star-light  With the breath from their pale faces.  About twelve by the moon-dial,  One more filmy than the rest  (A kind which, upon trial,  They have found to be the best)  Comes down?still down?and down  With its centre on the crown  Of a mountain?s eminence,  While its wide circumference  In easy drapery falls  Over hamlets, over halls,  Wherever they may be?  O?er the strange woods?o?er the sea?  Over spirits on the wing?  Over every drowsy thing?  And buries them up quite  In a labyrinth of light?  And then, how, deep! ?O, deep,  Is the passion of their sleep.  In the morning they arise,  And their moony covering  Is soaring in the skies,  With the tempests as they toss,  Like?almost any thing?  Or a yellow Albatross.  They use that moon no more  For the same end as before,  Videlicet, a tent?  Which I think extravagant:  Its atomies, however,  Into a shower dissever,  Of which those butterflies  Of Earth, who seek the skies,  And so come down again  (Never-contented things!)  Have brought a specimen  Upon their quivering wings","Poe, Edgar Allan",Fairy-Land,Poem,,,,"Lazear, Suzanne",Charmed Vengeance,US,2013,"Fiction, Young Adult Fiction",1829,9780738733029,,

I was a child and she was a child,     In this kingdom by the sea,  But we loved with a love that was more than love?     I and my Annabel Lee?  With a love that the wingäd seraphs of Heaven     Coveted her and me.   And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea,  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;  So that her highborn kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,  To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.   The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,     Went envying her and me?  Yes!?that was the reason (as all men know,     In this kingdom by the sea)  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,     Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.   But our love it was stronger by far than the love     Of those who were older than we?     Of many far wiser than we?  And neither the angels in Heaven above     Nor the demons down under the sea  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;   For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side     Of my darling?my darling?my life and my bride,     In her sepulchre there by the sea?
